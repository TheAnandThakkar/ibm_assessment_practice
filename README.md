# IBM Assessment Course Solutions for Backend and Software Developer

Welcome to this repository containing **JavaScript solutions** for the IBM assessment course questions targeted at backend and software developer roles. These solutions are inspired by the YouTube channel **"Apne Wale Coders"**, where most of the examples are solved in C++. I‚Äôve translated and solved all problems in **JavaScript** to provide a new perspective, which might be helpful if you're more comfortable with JavaScript.

## About This Repository

This repository includes approximately **20 questions**, each of which has been carefully solved in JavaScript. The solutions follow a logical approach to tackle common assessment questions, making it a great resource for those preparing for IBM‚Äôs backend or software developer assessments.

## YouTube Source

Most of the original solutions can be found on the [Apne Wale Coders YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIUso1jSUd-Y9E2mxrhz5dqaldmZCtVxT), where they provide explanations and solutions primarily in C++. If you‚Äôd like to compare languages or just want a detailed walkthrough in C++, I highly recommend checking it out.

## Contents

Each solution covers key problem-solving techniques often tested in backend and software developer assessments, including:

- **Data Structures** - Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, etc.
- **Algorithms** - Sorting, Searching, Optimization Problems.
- **Logic Building** - Challenges that build logical thinking and approach to problem-solving.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Browse through each question** to find the JavaScript solution for the respective problem.
- **Suggest improvements**: If you come up with a more efficient or cleaner solution, feel free to contribute!

## Contribution Guidelines

If you find a better way to solve any of these problems, please feel free to:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Submit a pull request with your optimized solution.

Collaboration is always welcome and beneficial for everyone involved.

## Disclaimer

This repository is meant for educational purposes only and is not an official IBM resource. The aim is to share solutions in JavaScript for the benefit of those who may find it more convenient or helpful than the original C++ solutions.
